An Instagram bot written in Python using Selenium on Google Chrome. It will go through posts in hashtag(s) and like and/or comment on them.

_**Created and tested on Windows, if you have Mac there may be some complications with running Selenium._

_**Disclaimer - I rarely upkeep this, so some Xpaths may occasionally not work if Instagram updates their code, but I'll get to fixing it eventually._
